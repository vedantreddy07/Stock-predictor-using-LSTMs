# Stock-predictor-using-LSTMs
This project implements a Stock Price Prediction Model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence and time-series data.  The model is trained on historical stock price data  and attempts to predict future stock prices based on past trends.
