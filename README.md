📈 Stock Price Predictor using LSTMs

An intelligent deep learning project that predicts stock price movements using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model is trained on historical stock market data and provides future price trend forecasts with visualization.

🚀 Features

📂 Process historical stock price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
🔍 LSTM-based deep learning model for time-series forecasting
📊 Visual comparison of actual vs. predicted stock prices
⚡ Scalable to any stock dataset (Yahoo Finance, CSV files, etc.)
🧪 Configurable parameters: sequence length, batch size, epochs, etc.

🖼️ Model Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Scaling, normalization, and sequence generation
