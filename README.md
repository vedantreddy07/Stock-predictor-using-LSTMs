📈 Stock Price Predictor using LSTMs

This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for time-series forecasting of stock prices. By training on historical stock market data, the model attempts to predict future price trends.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing (scaling, normalization, sequence creation)

LSTM-based deep learning model for prediction

Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices

Easy to extend for different stock datasets

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

📊 Results

The model successfully captures short-term stock price trends.

Predictions are compared with actual values using plots.

⚠️ Note: Stock prices are influenced by external unpredictable factors. This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real trading or investment.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, etc.)

Integrate news sentiment analysis

Experiment with GRUs / Transformer models
